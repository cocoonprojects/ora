Scenario: Creating a new Task
	Given that I want to make a new "Task"
	And that its "subject" is "UNA ROTONDA SUL MARE"
	And that its "streamID" is "1"
	When I request "/task-management/task"
	Then the response is JSON
	And the response has a "taskId" property
	And the type of the "taskId" property is numeric
