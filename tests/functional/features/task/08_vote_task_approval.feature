Feature: Completed Work Item Voting (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/116529995)
	As an organization member
	I want to vote for (or against) a completed work item
	to contribute to the approval process

Scenario: One member cast a positive vote
	Given that I am authenticated as "mark.rogers@ora.local"
	And that I want to cast a new "Vote"
	And that its "value" is "1"
	And that its "description" is "I like it"
	When I request "/60000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000020/acceptances"
	Then the response status code should be 201
	And the response should be JSON
	And the "status" property should be "30"
	And the response should have a "acceptances" property
	And the "acceptances" property size should be greater or equal than "1"

# Coupled with the "One member cast a positive vote" scenario
Scenario: One member can only vote a completed work item once
	Given that I am authenticated as "mark.rogers@ora.local"
	And that I want to cast a new "Vote"
	And that its "value" is "1"
	When I request "/60000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000020/acceptances"
	Then the response status code should be 409

Scenario: Only organization members are allowed to vote
 	Given that I am authenticated as "paul.smith@ora.local"
	And that I want to cast a new "Vote"
	And that its "value" is "1"
	When I request "/60000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000020/acceptances"
	Then the response status code should be 403

# Coupled with the "One member cast a positive vote" scenario
Scenario: Another one member cast a positive vote to accept the task
	Given that I am authenticated as "phil.toledo@ora.local"
	And that I want to cast a new "Vote"
	And that its "value" is "1"
	When I request "/60000000-0000-0000-1000-000000000000/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000020/acceptances"
	Then the response status code should be 201
	And the response should be JSON
	And the "status" property should be "40"
	And the response should have a "acceptances" property
	And the "acceptances" property size should be greater or equal than "1"
	And after I want to find a "FlowCard"
	And I request "/flow-management/cards"
	#And echo last response
	And the response should be JSON
	And the "count" property should be "1"
	And the response should contain 'The vote for this work completed item is closed'
	And the response should contain '"itemId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000020"'

# Influenced by "Another one member cast a positive vote to accept the task" scenario

	And the response should contain 'and the item has been reopened'
	And the response should contain '"itemId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000021"'

	And that its "description" is "I like it"
	When I request "/00000000-0000-0000-2000-000000000000/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000022/acceptances"
