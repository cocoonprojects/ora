	As a member of a task if I haven't estimated it yet
	I want to unjoin the task
	in order to not be involved any more in task related activities

Scenario: Successfully unjoining an ongoing task the logged user is member of

	When I request "/task-management/tasks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/members"
	Then the response status code should be 200
